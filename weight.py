### weight() ###
This function will check the weight of the item, then print the cost of mailing the item.
1) Accept weight from user in ounces.
    a) Attempt to convert the input into a float, provided that the number is a positive number.
    b) Save float to item['weight'].
2) If item['type'] is standard or irregular, check that the weight is not more than 3.5 ounces.
    All packages that are more than 3.5 oz must be mailed as a large envelope, not a standard/irregular envelope.
    a) check_heavy_reg_envelope checks if item['weight'] is heavier than 3.5 oz.
    b) If it's heavier than 3.5 oz, update item['type'] to large
