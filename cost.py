### calculate_cost() ###
This function will calculate and print the cost of mailing our item.
1) First, it checks the item['type'].
    a) If item['type'] is 'standard' or 'irregular', calculate using standard postage pricing.
    b) If item['type'] is 'large', calculate using large postage pricing.
2) From there, write two helper functions: one to calculate standard pricing, another to calculate large pricing
    a) For standard pricing:
        1. Base postage cost should be a FOREVER stamp, which we save as a constant. This makes it easier to update
            the cost of the stamp as prices increase over time.
        2. Initialize item['cost'] to be the base postage cost.
        3. Additionally, initialize item['add_oz'] to be 0. item['add_oz'] will track the number of additional
            ounce stamps needed to mail our item.
        4. If the weight is less than or equal to 1 oz, the postage price will remain as the item['cost'], as
            no additional ounce stamps will be needed. (One FOREVER stamp covers mail <= 1 oz.)
        5. If it's more than 1 oz and less than or equal to 3.5 oz, write a for loop with a range from 2-5 that:
            a. Update item['cost'] = base_postage + (ADDITIONAL_OZ * (i - 1))
            b. Update item['add_oz'] = i - 1
            c. Add a break so that the loop doesn't continue once the condition is met
            * Note: Our range is 2-5 because we want the loop to end before 5. (Max weight for standard envelope is 3.5.)
        6. If item['type'] is 'irregular', we have to add the 15Â¢ surcharge to item['cost'] and increase item['add_oz']
            by 1 (irregular items always have a 15Â¢ surcharge that can be covered by an add. oz stamp.)
    b) For large pricing:
        1. Base postage cost is LARGE_ENVELOPE_BASE, saved as a constant. This makes it easier to update the cost of
            the stamp as prices increase over time.
        2. Initialize item['cost'] to the base postage cost.
        3. If weight is less than or equal to 1 oz, the postage price will remain as the item['cost'].
        4. If weight is more than 1 oz and less than or equal to 13 oz, write a for loop with a range from 2-14 that
            adds LARGE_ENVELOPE_ADD_OZ for every additional 1 ounce.
            a. Update item['cost']  = (LARGE_ENVELOPE_ADD_OZ * (i - 1))
            c. Add a break so the loop doesn't continue once the condition is met
3) Finally, print the cost using print_cost().
    a) For standard and irregular envelopes:
        1. Print the cost of mailing the item.
        2. Print how many forever stamps and additional ounce stamps they'll need.
        3. Print the current value of forever stamps and additional ounce stamps.
        4. Link to USPS website to let user purchase stamps.
    b) For large envelopes:
        1. Print the cost of mailing the item.
        2. Print the current denominations of definitive-value stamps available for purchase.
        3. Link to USPS website to let user purchase stamps.
4) Once this function is finished executing, the program has finished checking the cost of the item in question.
    The program will go back to main() to ask the user if they want to check the cost of another item.
