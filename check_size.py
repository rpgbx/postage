### check_item() ###
This function will check the type of the item.
1) First, it needs to check if the item is a postcard.
    a) if it IS a postcard, program should print the cost/num of stamps to use. Set item type to 'postcard'.
    b) then, exit out of this function to return to main() -> will ask user if they want to check another item
2) If it is NOT a postcard, program should move onto checking if it's a standard envelope.
    a) if it IS a standard envelope, program should execute check_envelope_type() to check if it's
        a standard envelope or irregular envelope. check_envelope_type() will set item type.
    b) then, exit out of this function to return to main() -> continue to take weight of item.
3) Finally, if it is NEITHER a postcard, standard, or irregular envelope, program should check if it's a large envelope
    a) if it's a large envelope, it should set item's type to 'large'.
        Then, exit out of this function to return to main() -> continue to take weight of item.
    b) If it is none of the above, this means it's too large to be an envelope, and needs to be mailed as a parcel.
        Set item's type to 'parcel'.
    c) then, exit out of this function to return to main() -> will ask user if they want to check another item.
